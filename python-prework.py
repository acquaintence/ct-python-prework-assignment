# Question 1:
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function.
# The first line of the code has been defined as below.

def hello_name(user_name):
    print("hello_" + user_name + "!")

hello_name("Jenn")


# Question 2:
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing.

def first_odds():
    for i in range(1,100,2):
        print(i)

first_odds()


# Question 3
# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. 

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    max_num = max(a_list)
    return max_num


# Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. 
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
# The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

def is_leap_year(a_year): 
    if (a_year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    elif a_year % 4 == 0 and a_year % 100 != 0: 
        return True 
    else:
        return False


# Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. 
# For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. 
# The return should be boolean Type.

def is_consecutive(a_list):
    for pos, num in enumerate(a_list):
        if num - pos == a_list[0]:
            continue
        else:
            return False
    return True
